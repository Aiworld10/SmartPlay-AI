SmartPlayAI - Session Changes Log
=====================================
Date: 2025-10-08

## Summary
Separated the theme selection page from the game flow to create a cleaner user experience.
The theme selection now properly navigates to separate pages for questions, results, and leaderboard.

## Files Modified

### 1. templates/theme_selection.html
**Changes:**
- Removed HTMX attributes (hx-get, hx-target, hx-swap) from theme selection buttons
- Changed all theme selection buttons from HTMX buttons to regular anchor links
- Removed the `<div id="theme-selection-result">` container that was displaying questions inline
- Theme selection buttons now use href navigation: `/questions/random?theme={theme}&user_id={user_id}`

**Impact:**
- Theme selection page is now clean and only shows theme cards
- Clicking a theme navigates to a new page (question_game.html) instead of loading content inline
- Better separation of concerns between theme selection and game play

### 2. main.py
**Changes:**
- Fixed the `/leaderboard` endpoint by adding explicit import: `from model import crud as crud_ops`
- Updated the function to use `crud_ops.get_leaderboard(db, theme)` instead of `crud.get_leaderboard(db, theme)`

**Impact:**
- Leaderboard endpoint now works correctly without NameError
- API properly returns leaderboard data as JSON

### 3. model/crud.py
**Changes:**
- Fixed `get_leaderboard()` function on line 257
- Changed `func.count(models.Response.id)` to `func.count(models.Response.player_id)`
- Response model has composite primary key (player_id, question_id), not a single id field

**Impact:**
- Leaderboard query now executes without errors
- Correctly counts number of games played per player

### 4. templates/index.html
**Changes:**
- Updated "Check Leaderboard" link from `/leaderboard` to `/questions/leaderboard`
- Line 84: Changed href to point to the HTML leaderboard page instead of JSON API endpoint

**Impact:**
- "Check Leaderboard" button now displays the proper HTML leaderboard page
- Users see the formatted leaderboard UI instead of raw JSON data

### 5. templates/result.html
**Changes:**
- Fixed score display from "/ 10" to "/ 5" on line 116
- Matches the actual AI scoring system (1-5 points per question)

**Impact:**
- Score display now correctly shows "X / 5" instead of misleading "X / 10"
- Users understand the maximum possible score per question is 5 points
- Aligns frontend display with backend AI evaluation logic

## Existing Templates (Already Well-Structured)

### templates/question_game.html
- Already properly structured with timer, question display, and answer submission
- Uses localStorage to manage game state across page navigations
- Handles question progression and score tracking
- Redirects to result page after answer submission

### templates/result.html
- Already properly structured to show AI evaluation and verdict
- Displays score and progress information
- Handles navigation to next question or leaderboard
- Uses localStorage to retrieve and display result data

### templates/next_question.html
- Already properly structured to display subsequent questions
- Reuses the same game interface as question_game.html
- Properly manages state continuation from result page

### templates/leaderboard.html
- Already properly structured with ranking display
- Fetches leaderboard data via API call to `/leaderboard`
- Supports theme filtering via URL parameters
- Shows top players with medal icons and rankings

## Page Flow (After Changes)

1. **Login Page** (index.html) → User logs in
2. **Theme Selection** (theme_selection.html) → User selects theme (Survival/Work/Interview)
3. **Question Page** (question_game.html) → User answers question with timer (60s)
4. **Result Page** (result.html) → Shows AI evaluation, verdict, and score
5. **Next Question** (next_question.html) → Displays next question (repeats steps 3-5)
6. **Leaderboard** (leaderboard.html) → Shows final rankings after 5 questions

## Technical Details

**Navigation Method:**
- Changed from HTMX inline loading to full page navigation
- Better for game flow and state management
- Cleaner separation between pages

**State Management:**
- Game state stored in localStorage
- Persists across page navigations
- Cleared when user completes game or goes home

**Backend Compatibility:**
- No major backend changes required
- Existing routes already support full page rendering
- Leaderboard endpoint fixed for proper CRUD import

## Testing Required

1. ✅ Theme selection navigates to question page
2. ✅ Question timer works correctly
3. ✅ Answer submission and AI evaluation
4. ✅ Result page displays properly
5. ✅ Navigation to next question
6. ✅ Leaderboard displays after 5 questions
7. ✅ Score tracking across questions

## Notes

- The application already had well-structured templates for the game flow
- Main issue was HTMX loading questions inline on the theme selection page
- Minimal changes required to achieve proper page separation
- Design consistency maintained across all pages (Bootstrap 5 + Font Awesome)
- All pages use similar styling (card-based, centered layout, fade-in animations)
