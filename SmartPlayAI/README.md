1.    Project Vision
SmartPlay AI is a chat-based simulation platform that uses large language models (LLMs) to generate dynamic scenarios across survival, school, work, social, and moral themes.

The AI evaluates answers, applies creative twists, and delivers immediate feedback, turning each interaction into an engaging learning experience.
